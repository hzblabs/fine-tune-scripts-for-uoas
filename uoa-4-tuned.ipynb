Jones, MD, PhD, MRCPsych; Matthew Owens, PhD; Michelle C. St Clair, PhD; Esther M. F. van Sluijs, PhD; Ian M. Goodyer, MD, FRCPsych IMPORTANCE Physical activity (PA) may have a positive effect on depressed mood. However, whether it can act as a protective factor against developing depressive symptoms in adolescence is largely unknown. OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between objectively measured PA and depressive symptoms during 3 years of adolescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We performed a longitudinal study between November 1, 2005, and January 31, 2010, of a community-based sample from Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, United Kingdom, that included 736 participants (mean [SD] age, 14.5 years [6 months]). The follow-up period was approximately 3 years after baseline (the ROOTS study). Linear regression models were fitted using physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as the predictors and depressive symptoms as the outcome variable. Binomial logistic regression models were also fitted using PAEE and MVPA as the predictors and clinical depression as the outcome measure. EXPOSURES Exercise. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Individually calibrated heart rate and movement sensing were used to measure PA at baseline only. Physical activity summary measures included total PAEE and time spent in MVPA. These measures were divided into weekend and weekday activity. All participants also completed the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, a self-report measure of current depressive symptoms, and took part in a Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version interview at baseline and 3 years later. RESULTS Depressive symptoms at 3-year follow-up were not significantly predicted by any of the 4 PA measures at baseline: weekend MVPA (unstandardized β = 0.02; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.20; P = .79), weekday MVPA (β = 0.00; 95% CI, −0.17 to 0.17; P = .99), weekend PAEE (β = 0.03; 95% CI, −0.14 to 0.20; P = .75), and weekday PAEE (β = −0.03; 95% CI, −0.20 to 0.14; P = .71). This was also true for major depressive disorder diagnoses at follow-up: weekend MVPA (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 0.76-2.48; P = .30), weekday MVPA (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.74-2.37; P = .34), weekend PAEE (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.67-2.10; P = .56), and weekday PAEE (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.52-1.63; P = .78). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No longitudinal association between objectively measured PA and the development of depressive symptoms was observed in this large population-based sample. These results do not support the hypothesis that PA protects against developing depressive symptoms in adolescence.

D epression is a major contributor to the global burden of disease.1-3 A reduction in the associated personal and financial costs would benefit society. The onset of depression is thought to be in adolescence or earlier,4-9 and so preventive measures during this vulnerable stage in life would be beneficial. Physical activity (PA) has been cited in numerous reports as a potential moderator in reducing the risk of clinical depression; however, the evidence for such an effect is less than clear-cut. Psychosocial explana- tions for why PA may help with depressed mood include increased opportunity of social interaction, leading to increased social support10; distraction from symptoms that induce stress11; and the feeling of accomplishment, which may promote a more positive outlook.12 Cross-sectional research has found that overall PA levels areassociatedwithdepressivesymptomsduringadolescence,13 but there is no independent effect of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA).13,14 The longitudinal evidence is equivocal, with some evidence that low levels of PA in early adolescence do not predict the onset of depression or depres- sive symptoms in later adolescence,15-18 whereas other studies19-22 report a significant effect. Randomized clinical trials have been equally inconclusive because of constraints such as poor methodological design and small observed effect size.23-25 One randomized clinical trial found that aero- bic exercise reduced depression in the first 5 weeks but not thereafter.26 The aforementioned studies and others16,27-31 used self- report measures of depressive symptoms in community samples. Self-report measures of depressive symptoms, such astheMoodandFeelingsQuestionnaire(MFQ),arewidelyused in mental health research and have been found to have high criterion validity.32 Contrary to this, self-report measures of PA are known to have considerable error, and a tendency to over- reporttheintensityofPAwhencomparedwithmeasurestaken objectively has been noted in adolescents.33 All the longitu- dinal research that investigates the prospective association be- tween PA and depressive symptoms has relied on self-report measures of PA.15-22 The cross-sectional research that has used objective measures of PA in adolescents used heart rate moni- toring or accelerometry alone.13,14,34 Even though these measures are objective and may be pre- ferred to self-report methods, they have limitations. For ex- ample,becauseaccelerometersareusuallywornatthehip,they are not able to accurately measure activities, such as cycling, which predominantly requires lower body movements, or cer- tain household chores that only require upper body move- ment. Similarly, heart rate can change as a result of stress or other factors that are unrelated to PA. We are not aware of any studies that have used combined heart rate monitoring and ac- celerometry when investigating adolescent mental health, al- though these measures have been used in older patients with unipolar and bipolar depression.35 We believe that this com- bined measurement of PA provides a more accurate represen- tation of the PA undertaken by adolescents. To our knowledge, to date, the research that has exam- ined the association between depressive symptoms and ob- jectively measured PA has used a cross-sectional design, and those studies that have used a longitudinal design have used self-report measures of PA. We therefore investigated the as- sociation between objectively measured PA and depressive symptoms in a longitudinal study. It was hypothesized that those participants with higher levels of PA in early adoles- cence would have lower levels of depressive symptoms at the 2.5-year follow-up. Methods Participants This longitudinal study was performed between November 1, 2005, and January 31, 2010. All 1238 participants in the ROOTS study cohort,36 a community sample of adolescents attend- ing schools in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, were invited to take part in the PA substudy and 909 (73.4%) participated. The ROOTS study was approved by the Cambridge University Re- searchEthicsCommittee.Writtenparentalandparticipantcon- sent was obtained at all data collection points. Of these 909 participants,173(19.0%)providedinsufficientvalidPAdataand were excluded (see below). Physical activity data from 736 par- ticipants(418girlsand318boys)wereavailableatbaseline.The Acorn index (http://acorn.caci.co.uk) was used as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES) . Categories were combined to rep- resent high (wealthy achievers and urban prosperity), middle (financially comfortable), and low (moderate means and fi- nancially strained) SESs. Design Physical activity data were collected at time 1 (mean [SD] age, 15.0 years [3.6 months]). Approximately 6 months before this, participants had completed psychosocial measures as part of the wider ROOTS study (time 0) (mean [SD] age, 14.5 years [6 months]). These data collection points are collectively re- ferred to as baseline in the present analyses. The ROOTS study cohort was followed up approximately 3 years after time 0, and psychosocial measures were taken; we call this follow-up visit time 2 (mean [SD] age, 17.5 years [3.6 months]). PA Measurement At baseline, PA was assessed using combined heart rate and movement sensing (Actiheart, CamNtech Ltd).37-39 The moni- tor clips onto 2 electrocardiographic electrodes and is posi- tioned in the midline just below the xiphisternum and at- tached via a 70- to 100-mm wire to a smaller clip horizontally to the left chest wall. Both parts were secured to the skin via standardelectrocardiographicelectrodepads.Participantsper- formed an 8-minute step test,40 after which the monitor was set up to record data in 30-second epochs. Participants were asked to wear the monitor continuously for the remainder of the testing day and then for 4 consecutive days, including 2 weekend days (mean [SD] weekday wear time, 60.75 [12.41] hours; and mean [SD] weekend wear time, 43.10 [6.47] hours).

This was summarized into PA energy expendi- ture (PAEE) and MVPA as intensity of 4 metabolic equivalents or more, while minimizing diurnal bias caused by any imbal- ance of wear or nonwear using the 2-sine regression method.43 Data were split by weekend and weekday PA. Four PA vari- ables were generated: weekend MVPA, weekday MVPA, week- end PAEE, and weekday PAEE. Each of the 4 PA variables was positively skewed and therefore split into tertiles. Valid PA data were defined as 32 hours or more of data for weekdays and 16 hours or more for weekends. In addition, the day was divided into quadrants (3 AM to 9 AM, 9 AM to 3 PM, 3 PM to 9 PM, and 9 PM to 3 AM), and each quadrant was required to have 4 hours or more of valid activity data for the estimate to be included. Psychological Outcomes At baseline and follow-up, participants were asked to com- plete the 33-item MFQ,44 a self-report measure of depressed mood during the prior 2 weeks, which has validity as a screen for adolescents with unipolar depression.32 The MFQ in- cludes symptoms such as low mood, loss of appetite, anhe- donia, irritability, and restlessness (see http://devepi.duhs .duke.edu/mfq.htmlfor full details). Higher summed MFQ scores indicate increased risk for subsequent unipolar depression.45-47 The internal consistency in this sample was high(Cronbachα = 0.96).Ofthesampleof736participantswho provided PA data at baseline, 690 (93.8%) provided MFQ data atbaselineand614(83.4%)atfollow-up.Atbaselineandfollow- up, all adolescents were assessed face-to-face for current epi- sodes of major depressive disorder (MDD) using sections of the ScheduleforAffectiveDisordersandSchizophreniaforSchool- Age Children–Present and Lifetime Version, a clinical inter- view, to generate Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) Axis I diagnoses.48 Interviews were conducted by fully trained research assistants, and diagnoses were reached at consensus meetings with senior staff, includ- ing adolescent psychiatrists. The Schedule for Affective Dis- ordersandSchizophreniaforSchool-AgeChildren–Presentand LifetimeVersiondatawereavailablefor718participants(97.6%) at baseline and 671 (91.2%) at follow-up. Other Measurements At baseline, height (Leicester height measures; Chasmors Ltd) andweight(TBF-300Abodycompositionanalyzer;Tanita)were measured. Body mass index was then calculated. The Inter- national Obesity Task Force body mass index cutoff points49 were used to classify participants as normal weight and over- weight or obese. Also at baseline, participants completed the Tanner Scale50,51 and provided salivary samples (pubertal sta- tus was determined using previously published methods52). Information regarding participants’ medication use was ob- tained from parents at baseline. Statistical Analyses Analyses were conducted in STATA statistical software, ver- sion 12.0 (Stata Corp). In all analyses, the PA variables were di- vided into tertiles. Sex, SES, medications, pubertal status, and weight class were included in separate models as covariates. The main effects of PA and sex were tested in separate models to the interaction effects between PA and sex. To investigate the baseline effect of PA on depressive symp- toms, we used 4 linear regression models (1 for each PA vari- able). Because the MFQ scores were not normally distrib- uted, they were transformed using the square root function and were entered as the outcome variable and PA and sex as the predictors. To investigate the longitudinal effects, the analyses were then performed again, and the MFQ at base- line was replaced with an MFQ at follow-up. Baseline and follow-up analyses were performed again, and all covariates were included. To investigate the baseline effect of PA on diagnoses of MDD at baseline, we used 4 binomial logistic regression analyses (separately for each of the PA variables). The out- come variable was entered as diagnosis (yes or high clinical index vs no), and the predictors were sex and PA. To investi- gate longitudinal effects, we performed the analyses again using MDD at follow-up instead of baseline. At baseline and follow-up, analyses were performed again, and all covariates were included. Results Descriptive Statistics The MFQ data for both time points were transformed using the square root function to improve the alignment to a gaussian distribution (original MFQ values are reported in Table 1). Descriptive statistics are given in Table 1. Physical activity tertiles were as follows: weekend MVPA (<15.73, ≤15.73-42.05, and ≥42.06 min/d), weekday MVPA (<25.68, ≤25.68-72.79, and ≥72.80 min/d), weekend PAEE (<26.04, ≤26.04-41.91, and ≥41.92 kJ/kg daily), and weekday PAEE (<44.66, ≤44.66-69.75, and ≥69.76 kJ/kg daily). No signifi- cant effect of SES was found on any of the 4 PA measures (weekend MVPA, P = .73; weekday MVPA, P = .46; weekend PAEE, P = .36; and weekday PAEE, P = .65). The MFQ scores at baseline were higher in the moderate means and finan- cially strained group compared with those who were finan- cially comfortable (z = 3.05, P = .002) and compared with the wealthy (z = 3.22, P = .001) group; however, these did not differ from each other. The MFQ at follow-up did not differ by SES. On a weekend day, normal-weight adolescents took part in more MVPA compared with overweight and obese participants (z = 2.04, P = .04). This was also true for week- day MVPA (z = 2.23, P = .03). These differences were not pres- ent for weekend PAEE (P = .16), weekday PAEE (P = .09), or MFQ scores at baseline (P = .08) or follow-up (P = .48). Boys were more active than girls in all 4 PA measures: weekend MVPA (z = −11.05, P < .01), weekday MVPA (z = −11.04, P < .01), weekend PAEE (z = −9.34, P < .01), and weekday PAEE (z = −9.92, P < .01). At baseline, participants who were using medications had higher MFQ scores than those who were not (t678 = 2.51, P = .01). The MFQ scores at follow-up did not differ by medications (P = .28).

The MFQ score at follow-up was higher in pubertal compared with prepubertal participants (t599 = 4.14, P < .001); however, there was no difference in MFQ scores at baseline (P = .30), MDD at base- line (P = .91), or MDD at follow-up (P = .56). More boys accu- mulated 60 minutes or more of MVPA on weekend days (z = 34.11, P < .001) and on weekdays (z = 104.22, P < .001) compared with girls. The percentage of participants who met the 60-minute guidelines on a weekend day did not dif- fer based on SES (P = .91), weight group (P = .74), or medica- tions (P = .87). For weekdays, a higher percentage of normal- weight participants met the guidelines compared with the overweight or obese group (z = 4.23, P = .04), but no differ- ences were found in SES (P = .26) and medication use (P = .10). For weekend (z = 14.28, P < .001) and weekday MVPA (z = 20.53, P < .001), a higher percentage of prepuber- tal adolescents met the MVPA guidelines. No significant dif- ferences were found between the participants who provided valid PA data and those who did not in terms of MFQ score at baseline (P = .43), MFQ score at follow-up (P = .39), sex (P = .76), weight group (P = .52), medications (P = .55), pubertal status (P = .39), and SES (P = .30). Participants undertook more MVPA (z = 23.40, P < .01) and PAEE (z = 23.40, P < .01) on weekdays than they did on week- enddays.TheMVPAandPAEEwerehighlycorrelatedforweek- end (r = 0.87, P < .01) and weekdays (r = 0.88, P < .01). There- fore,thoseparticipantswhoengagedinmoreMVPAweremore physically active overall. In line with previous work,53 girls had higher MFQ scores than boys at baseline (t688 = 5.17, P < .01) and follow-up (t612 = 5.97, P < .01). There was also a signifi- cant overall correlation between MFQ scores at baseline and follow-up (r = 0.51, P < .01). PA and Depressive Symptoms For baseline and longitudinal analyses, no main effects of PA variables and no interactions between sex and PA were ob- served. These findings are given in Table 2.

These findings are concurrent with previous lon- gitudinalstudies15-18usingself-reportmeasuresofPA.Weareonly aware of 4 research studies19-22 that found an effect of PA on depressive symptoms during adolescence in a longitudinal design, all of which used a self-report method of assessing PA.

Our findings do not eliminate the possibility that PApositivelyaffectsdepressedmoodinthegeneralpopulation; rather, we suggest that this effect may be small or nonexistent during the period of adolescence. Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions A major strength of the research reported here is the use of a re- liable, objective measure of PA used in the form of individually calibratedcombinedheartrateandmovementinformation.The researchdesignwasstrengthenedfurtherwiththelongitudinal aspect, which allowed us to examine the prognostic role of PA indeterminingdepressiveoutcomes.WealsoincludedMDDdi- agnosesintheanalyses,whichstrengthenedthedesignfurther because,althoughself-reportmeasuresofdepressivesymptoms arewidelyused,interviewsarearguablymorerigorous.Withthe useofadiagnosticinterview,thispotentialbias,whichmayhave been increased by self-report, is reduced.

Conclusions In this sample of adolescents, no association was found be- tween the levels of PA at 14 years of age and depressive out- comes at 17 years of age. That is, those participants who were more physically active in early adolescence did not subse- quently have significantly lower (or higher) depressive symp- toms or significantly altered odds of depressive disorders in later adolescence. Although it is important to promote PA because of its well-documented effect on physical health, during adolescence, PA may not serve as a strong protective factor of developing depressive symptoms or disorders.
